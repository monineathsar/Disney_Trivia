# Marvel Trivia 
## Creating a fun trivia game for people of all ages to sit back and enjoy.

--Overview
Working in a team of four. You are assigned to create a project that requires the use of 2 server-side APIs and an additional CSS Framework. Communicate with your team and decide who will be responsible for each task within your project.

### The Challenge:
In your team of four you will create and deploy a project that uses at least two server side APIs. Display an interactive project, have a polished UI, use client side storage that saves persistent data and is responsive to the viewers.
